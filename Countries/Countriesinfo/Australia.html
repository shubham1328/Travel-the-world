        <p>Surrounded by the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, the country of Australia is located in the continent of Oceania, and is the sixth largest country in the world. Being an island, Australia does not share its land borders with any country.
            It is separated from Asia by Arafura and Timor Seas, Queensland by the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea separates it from New Zealand.<br><br> A land of kangaroos, amazing wildlife, stunning sceneries, and a plethora of marine and fun activities,
            Australia is an ideal destination for an adventure junkie, nature enthusiast, beach lover or a party freak. Millions of travellers all around the world flock here to enjoy the unimaginable vistas, surf in the ocean and revel on its untouched
            islands. There are so much to do and see in Australia that several years will not be able to encompass all its attractions.<br><br> Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island is among the world’s best beaches that is blessed with silky white sand
            and crystal clear water. It offers some breathtaking sceneries while taking a day cruise to Hamilton Island. World-known Sydney Harbour is a mesmerizing place for visitors and locals alike for sailing, cruising, swimming at beaches, walking
            along the foreshore and picnicking. For bikers and travel enthusiasts, travel the Great Ocean Road to enjoy the world’s most scenic coastal drive and explore the natural wonders of 12 Apostles. For marine activities, take a dive into the blue
            waters of Boston Bay in Port Lincoln to get a chance to swim with rare and endangered Sea Lions in their natural habitat. There are a plethora of marine adventures as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland is ideal for snorkeling to enjoy underwater
            aquatic life. For hiking, explore the Three Capes Walking Track in Tasman National Park and enjoy the 360-degree view from the top.<br><br> Sydney is the capital of New South Wales and known for its harbour front Opera House, towering Sydney
            Tower’s glass viewing and the skywalk. Melbourne is Victoria’s coastal capital, famed for its arts, food and cultural events. Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, is famous for Queensland Museum and Queensland Gallery of Modern Art. Perth,
            the capital of Western Australia, is a place that sits on the cusp of Swan River and southwest coast, flaunting riverside botanical garden and parks.
            <br><br> Aussies are open and direct in their speech and sometimes can be sarcastic in their humour. Australia is an egalitarian society where there is no class distinction. The culture is heavily influenced by the British be it language,
            religion or sports.<br><br> </p>
