            <h3>About</h3>
            <br> Travel agencies often receive commissions and other benefits and incentives from providers or may charge a fee to the end users.Hotel owners and tour operators typically pay a higher commission rate to travel agencies, whereas airlines
            typically pay a low commission. The customer is normally not made aware of how much the travel agent is earning in commissions and other benefits.A 2016 survey of 1,193 travel agents in the United States found that on average 78% of their
            revenue was from commissions and 22% was generated from fees. Travel agencies use the services of the major computer reservations systems, also known as global distribution systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo GDS, Sabre, and Worldspan,
            which is a subsidiary of Travelport, which allow for comparison and sorting of hotel and flight rates with multiple companies.Bookings made via travel agents, including online travel agents, may or may not be confirmed instantly. Unlike online
            travel agencies, metasearch engines and scraper sites, such as Skyscanner, Kayak.com, Rome2rio, and TripAdvisor, may or may not have their own booking engine, and instead provide results for search queries and then divert traffic to service
            providers or online travel agencies for booking.Travel agents may also work with airline consolidators.
            <br> The CEN (European Committee for Standardization) definition for "tourist guide" – part of the work by CEN on definitions for terminology within the tourism industry – is a "person who guides visitors in the language of their choice and
            interprets the cultural and natural heritage of an area, which person normally possesses an area-specific qualification usually issued and/or recognized by the appropriate authority".CEN also defines a "tour manager" as a "person who manages
            and supervises the itinerary on behalf of the tour operator, ensuring the programme is carried out as described in the tour operator's literature and sold to the traveller/consumer and who gives local practical information".<br>
